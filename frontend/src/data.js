        "After the birth of our daughter Amy in 1987 we found there was little time to prepare wholesome nutritious food we normally ate. Realizing there were others like ourselves, we set up Amyâ€™s Kitchen to produce delicious, nourishing frozen meals for health-conscious people too by to cook.We use only the finest natural and organic ingredients and prepare them with the same careful attention in out kitchen as you would in your own home. No meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs or peanuts are ever used in Amyâ€™s products.Amy's uncle Billy ran a pizza parlor here in town, and when we asked him what was his most popular non-meat topping he answered without hesitation, Mushrooms & Olives (which is what we always order). We figured that Amy's customers would enjoy it too, so we added mushrooms and olives to our special pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese topping. Simply delicious.Everyone in our family loves pizza: for dinner, lunch, snacks, partiesâ€¦ even for breakfast. And everyone has a favorite. Amy and her friends like their pizzas with just cheese & sauce, and so did her grandma Clarice. Her dad goes for a spinach topping. Her mom & grandma Nonny prefer a cheeseless pizza with lots of veggies. So we decided to offer a variety of toppings. One thing everyone agreed on was that the crust has to be excellent. Not hard, soggy, or thin like cardboard. So we created a crust that is light, tender and tasty. The dough is made from organic Old Mill flour with a touch of olive oil to give it flavor and tenderness. Then itâ€™s handstretched and baked. After that we carefully add the toppings in perfect proportion to the crust.For variety you'll also want to try our Broccoli & Spinach Pizza with 3 Cheeses, Cheese Pizza, Cheese Pesto, Whole Wheat Crust Pizza, 4 Cheese Pizza, Margherita Pizza, Pesto Pizza, Pizza Italiano, Rice Crust Cheese Pizza, Rice Crust Spinach Pizza, Soy Cheese Pizza, Spinach Pizza, 3 Cheese-Cornmeal Crust Pizza, Vegan Margherita Pizza and Roasted Vegetable Pizza with no cheese.Find out more about our products, our company, our family, and what makes Amy's food so special at our website.Try These Other Products:Amy's Pocket Sandwiches.Amy's Soups.Amy's Chilis.Amy's Pasta Sauces.Amy's Burritos.Veggie Steak & Gravy Whole Meal.Enchilada Whole Meal.Veggie Loaf Whole Meal.Indian Mattar Paneer.Indian Palak Paneer.Indian Vegetable Korma.Chili & Cornbread Whole Meal.Cheese Enchilada.Black Bean & Vegetable Enchilada.Amy's Veggie Burgers.Amy's Bowls.Amy's Toaster Pops.Amy's Snacks.Amy's Salsa.Amy's Refried Beans.Asian Noodle Stir-Fry.Thai Stir-Fry.Cheese Lasagna.Apple Pie.Vegetable Pot Pie.Non-Dairy Vegetable Pot Pie.Broccoli Pot Pie.Mexican Tamale Pie.Macaroni & Cheese.Macaroni & Soy Cheeze.Tofu Vegetable Lasagna.Vegetable Lasagna.No GMOs Bioengineered Ingredients.0 g Trans fat.No added MSG.No preservatives.Amy's Kitchen does not use any peanuts, fish, shellfish or eggs.All dairy ingredients are made with pasteurized, rBST hormone-free milk and do not contain animal enzymes or animal rennet.Certified Organic by QAI.Carton is recyclable.Please recycle where facilities exist.We like hearing from you.

        "After the birth of our daughter Amy in 1987, we found there was little time to prepare the quality homemade food we normally ate. Realizing there were others like ourselves, we set up Amy's Kitchen to prepare delicious meals for those who care about the food they eat but are often too busy to cook.We use only the finest ingredients and prepare them with the same careful attention in our kitchen as you would in your own home. No meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs or peanuts are ever used in any Amy's products.When Amy's introduced our vegan, gluten-free pizza with a spinach topping, customers loved it. However, some parents said their kids wouldn't eat spinach.So we decided to come out with this individual-sized, simple, basic cheese pizza as a delicious alternative for those who choose to avoid both dairy and gluten. The light, tender gluten free rice crust is topped with completely dairy-free, soy based mozzarella cheeze and Amy's signature Italian pizza sauce made with organic sun-ripened tomatoes and a special blend of herbs. And of course you can add your own favorite toppings!Pizza is always popular. But there are times when a full-sized pizza is too much to prepare and certainly too much for one person to eat. That's why we've created Amy's individual-sized single serve pizzas, which have the same great taste and high quality ingredients as our full-sized pizzas. They are just right for one person to eat for a quick lunch or a tasty snack!Gluten-free: Responding to customer requests, our chefs have created a line of Gluten Free pizzas with all the delicious flavor of our regular pizzas, but containing no gluten.Amy's Kitchen does not use any peanuts, fish, shellfish or eggs.Try these other gluten-free products:Amy's Salsa, Bistro Burger, Sonoma Burger, Black Bean Tamale Verde, Brown Rice & Vegetables Bowl, GF Bean & Rice Burrito, GF Bean & Cheese Burrito, Garden Vegetable Lasagna, Indian Vegetable Korma, Black Bean Enchilada Whole Meal, Tofu Scramble, Indian Mattar Tofu, Cheese Enchilada, Santa Fe Enchilada Bowl, Mexican Tofu Scramble, Baked Ziti Bowl, Brown Rice & Black-Eyed Peas Bowl, Cheese Tamale Verde, Amy's Chilis, Amy's Soups, Amy's Pasta Sauces, GF Chocolate Cake, Indian Paneer Tikka, Dairy Free, GF Rice Mac & Cheeze, Mexican Tamale Pie, Shepherd's Pie, Cheese Enchilada Whole Meal.Find out more about our products, our company, our family and what makes Amy's food so special at Amy's website.No-GMOs - No genetically engineered ingredients.Quality Assurance International (QAI) Certified Organic.Carton is made from 100% recycled paperboard.Carton is recyclable.We like hearing from you.

        "This flavor combines our great ice cream with chunks of chewy, fudgy brownies. These brownies are baked by Greyston bakery which provides employment & training to economically disadvantaged residents of Yonkers, NY. We are glad to have Greyston as a business partner because we get great tasting brownies and we also get to support the good work they do to create economic opportunity in their community. Enjoy!

        "We can't remember who said what when about cinnamon buns, but that's all it took for us to roll out the cinnamon dough, swirl in the streusel & make this flavor happen. Our cool salute to cinnamon buns is sensationally cinnamon-sugary, irresistibly streuseled & so deliriously dough-loaded, there's no telling where the cinnamon buns end or the ice creams begins. That's because it's one fun flavor all the way through. Enjoy! We oppose recombinant bovine growth hormone. The family farmers who supply our milk and cream pledge not to treat their cows with rBGH.
